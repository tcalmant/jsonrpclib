Welcome to JSONRPClib-pelix
###########################

This library implements the JSON-RPC 2.0 proposed specification in pure Python.
It is designed to be as compatible with the syntax of ``xmlrpclib`` as possible
(it extends where possible), so that projects using ``xmlrpclib`` could easily
be modified to use JSON and experiment with the differences.

It is backwards-compatible with the 1.0 specification, and supports all of the
new proposed features of 2.0, including:

* Batch submission (via the ``MultiCall`` class)
* Keyword arguments
* Notifications (both in a batch and *normal*)
* Class translation using the ``__jsonclass__`` key.

A ``SimpleJSONRPCServer`` class has been added. It is intended to emulate the
``SimpleXMLRPCServer`` from the default Python distribution.

Why JSON-RPC?
*************

In my opinion, there are several reasons to choose JSON over XML for RPC:

* Much simpler to read (I suppose this is opinion, but I know I'm right. :)
* Size / Bandwidth - Main reason, a JSON object representation is just much smaller.
* Parsing - JSON should be much quicker to parse than XML.
* Easy class passing with ``jsonclass`` (when enabled)

In the interest of being fair, there are also a few reasons to choose XML
over JSON:

* Your server doesn't do JSON (rather obvious)
* Wider XML-RPC support across APIs (can we change this? :))
* Libraries are more established, i.e. more stable (Let's change this too.)


About this version
******************

This is a patched version of the original ``jsonrpclib`` project by
Josh Marshall, available at https://github.com/joshmarshall/jsonrpclib.

The suffix *-pelix* only indicates that this version works with Pelix Remote
Services, but it is **not** a Pelix specific implementation.

* This version adds support for Python 3, staying compatible with Python 2.7.
* It is now possible to use the dispatch_method argument while extending
  the SimpleJSONRPCDispatcher, to use a custom dispatcher.
  This allows to use this package by Pelix Remote Services.
* It can use thread pools to control the number of threads spawned to handle
  notification requests and clients connections.
* The modifications added in other forks of this project have been added:

  * From https://github.com/drdaeman/jsonrpclib:

    * Improved JSON-RPC 1.0 support
    * Less strict error response handling

  * From https://github.com/tuomassalo/jsonrpclib:

    * In case of a non-pre-defined error, raise an AppError and give access to
      *error.data*

  * From https://github.com/dejw/jsonrpclib:

    * Custom headers can be sent with request and associated tests

* Since version 0.4, this package added back the support of Unix sockets.
* This version cannot be installed with the original ``jsonrpclib``, as it uses
  the same package name.
